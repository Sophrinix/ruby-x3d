RelaX3D is a  Ruby library that allows  you to easily create  X3D scenes using
the  Ruby language.  It  was designed  to be  simple,  and does  not currently
implement all of X3D's tag elements.

== Usage

Depending on how  you write your library,  the usage  will vary.  All examples
were written so  that  they  will  be  executed  using  the following command,
however:

 ruby [file].rb > [output].x3d

Refer to the doc directory for documentation on the library itself.

= Prerequisites

You need Ruby and the Builder  gem.  I.e.  after you install Ruby on your Unix
machine (be it Linux,  OSX,  or Solaris;  of which only Linux and Solaris were
tested) you have to run the  following command (after downloading the ruby-gem
package)

 # gem install builder

You may need extra libraries for some of the examples;  see the README file in
the examples for more information.
