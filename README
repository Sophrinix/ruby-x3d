RelaX3D is a  Ruby library that allows  you to easily create  X3D scenes using
the  Ruby language.  It  was designed  to be  simple,  and does  not currently
implement  all of  X3D's tag  elements.  All  the  results  were  tested using
FreeWRL.


It is the aim of Andrew's fork to fully implement the entire X3D spec, as I have a pretty advanced need for a more then less complete X3D library in Ruby.

This includes the following specs:
ISO-IEC-19774 		Humanoid Animation
ISO-IEC-19775 		X3D Abstract Specification & 2 X3D Scene Access Interface 
ISO-IEC-19776   	X3D Encodings ClassicVRML & 3 X3D Encodings Compressed Binary
ISO-IEC-19777  		X3D Language Bindings ECMAScript (confirmed) and Java (maybe)
ISO-IEC-FCD-19775   X3D Scene Access Interface
ISO-IEC-FCD-19776	X3D Encodings Compressed Binary
ISO-IEC-FDIS-19776	X3D Encodings XML

Please reference the following link for the formal specs:

Right now this goal is no where near close to being completed.

== Usage

Depending on how  you write your library,  the usage  will vary.  All examples
were written so  that  they  will  be  executed  using  the following command,
however:

 ruby [file].rb > [output].x3d

Refer to the doc directory for documentation on the library itself.

= Prerequisites

You need Ruby and the Builder  gem.  I.e.  after you install Ruby on your Unix
machine (be it Linux,  OSX,  or Solaris;  of which only Linux and Solaris were
tested) you have to run the  following command (after downloading the ruby-gem
package)

 # gem install builder

You may need extra libraries for some of the examples;  see the README file in
the examples for more information.
