= TODO

The library's development was driven by a Virtual Reality project that I was
doing. As thus, only the tags that I needed were implemented. If I were to
continue working with X3D then the remainder of the tags will be implemented.
Aside from that, the following design flaws would be fixed:

* Avoid using random numbers when creating :DEF attributes for tags
* Add the ability to use the USE attribute for tags
* Add more examples
